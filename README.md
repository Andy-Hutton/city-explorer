# city-explorer

**Author**: Andy Hutton
**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Initially project from class 6. The app is called city-explorer and is designed to assist people on foinding out information on any searched city.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
I would advise to clone repo from git hub, install axios and you should be up and running.<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
Wrote some code in JS, styled using bootstrap/ css. Imported api and set a sync to prevent any issues whilst rendering page.
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
